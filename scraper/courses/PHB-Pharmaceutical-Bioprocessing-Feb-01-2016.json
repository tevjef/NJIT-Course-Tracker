This special course covers areas of study in which one or more students may be interested, but which is not of sufficiently broad interest to warrant a regular course offering. Students may not register for this course more than once with the same supervising faculty member.","sections":[{"section_number":"080","call_number":"13950","status":"Closed","instructor":"Armenante Piero","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13950","credits":"3.00"},{"section_number":"090","call_number":"13951","status":"Closed","instructor":"Bilgili Ecevit","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13951","credits":"3.00"},{"section_number":"111","call_number":"13952","status":"Closed","instructor":"Simon Laurent","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13952","credits":"3.00"},{"section_number":"116","call_number":"13953","status":"Closed","instructor":"Gogos Costas","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13953","credits":"3.00"}]}
