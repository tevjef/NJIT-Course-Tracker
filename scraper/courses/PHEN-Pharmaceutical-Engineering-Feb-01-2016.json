{"name":"INDEPENDENT STUDY","number":"725","description":"Prerequisites: permission from the graduate advisor (not the thesis advisor) in pharmaceutical engineering, as well as courses prescribed by a supervising faculty member (who is not the student's thesis advisor). This special course covers areas of study in which one or more students may be interested, but which is not of sufficiently broad interest to warrant a regular course offering. Students may not register for this course more than once with the same supervising faculty member.","sections":[{"section_number":"080","call_number":"13983","status":"Closed","now":4,"instructor":"Armenante Piero","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13983","credits":"3.00"},{"section_number":"090","call_number":"13984","status":"Closed","now":2,"instructor":"Bilgili Ecevit","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13984","credits":"3.00"},{"section_number":"111","call_number":"13985","status":"Closed","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13985","credits":"3.00"},{"section_number":"156","call_number":"13986","status":"Closed","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13986","credits":"3.00"},{"section_number":"212","call_number":"15102","status":"Closed","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=15102","credits":"3.00"},{"section_number":"391","call_number":"13987","status":"Closed","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13987","credits":"3.00"},{"section_number":"486","call_number":"13988","status":"Closed","instructor":"Khusid Boris","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=13988","credits":"3.00"}]}
