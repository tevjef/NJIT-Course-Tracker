Students learn to develop quantitative models of organs and organ systems from an engineering viewpoint. Students translate their understanding of physiological systems into models that evolve dynamically based on engineering block diagrams.  Additional topics include: hierarchical structure, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, negative feedback control, and characteristic traits of models.  Students will use models to gain insight into how a physiological system functions and to design a biomedical engineering device or procedure that interacts with the physiological system.  Systems studied include the cardiovascular system,  gas exchange in the lungs, nerve and muscle action potentials, and musculo-skeletal spinal reflex.","sections":[{"section_number":"002","call_number":"10295","meeting_time":[{"day":"M","start_time":"08:30AM","end_time":"09:55AM","room":"FENS698"},{"day":"R","start_time":"08:30AM","end_time":"09:55AM","room":"FENS698"},{"day":"W","start_time":"10:00AM","end_time":"12:10PM","room":"FENS698"}],"status":"Open","max":40,"now":30,"instructor":"Hunter William","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=spring%202016\u0026crn-1=10295","credits":"3.00"}]}
