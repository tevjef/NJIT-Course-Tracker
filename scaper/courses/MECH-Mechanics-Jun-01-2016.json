For chemical engineering and electrical engineering majors. Statics provides an understanding of the equilibrium of particles and rigid bodies, including simple machines, trusses, and frictional forces. Mechanics of materials covers pressure vessels, thermal stresses, torsion of shafts, stresses and deflection in beams, and column action.","sections":[{"section_number":"111","call_number":"52498","meeting_time":[{"day":"M","start_time":"6:00PM","end_time":"9:05PM","room":"FMH321"},{"day":"W","start_time":"6:00PM","end_time":"9:05PM","room":"FMH321"},{"day":"R","start_time":"6:00PM","end_time":"9:05PM","room":"FMH321"}],"status":"Open","max":30,"instructor":"Mahgoub Mohamed","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=summer%202016\u0026crn-1=52498","credits":"3.00"}]}
