Teams of students work on open-ended engineering projects.  Sections are offered to represent an introduction to real-world engineering design problems in a specific engineering discipline.  Topics covered include introduction to basic engineering design elements, processes, measurements, product and project design and development, with hands-on experiments in a specific major area.  Students also learn to use engineering tools for computer-aided design and simulation.  Technical writing and oral presentation along with project management skills are emphasized.  Students are required to take an FED section corresponding to their declared major.  Undecided students will be placed in FED sections which best correspond to their interests according to space availability.","sections":[{"section_number":"HSU","call_number":"52410","meeting_time":[{"day":"M","start_time":"09:00AM","end_time":"12:00PM","room":"MALLPC40"},{"day":"T","start_time":"09:00AM","end_time":"12:00PM","room":"MALLPC40"},{"day":"W","start_time":"09:00AM","end_time":"12:00PM","room":"MALLPC40"},{"day":"R","start_time":"09:00AM","end_time":"12:00PM","room":"MALLPC40"}],"status":"Closed","book_url":"http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=584\u0026term_id-1=summer%202016\u0026crn-1=52410","credits":"2.00"}]}
